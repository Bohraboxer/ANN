# ANN (Multi Layer Perceptron)

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

MNIST sample images.
Sample images from MNIST test dataset.
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

I Experimented with adding different hidden layers and with or without Batch processing and dropout layers.

   1) Without using hidden layers.                
   
   2) Using 2 hidden layers without dropout & batch normalization.
   
   3) Using 2 hidden layers with dropout & batch normalization.
   
   4) Using 3 hidden layers without dropout & batch normalization.
   
   5) Using 3 hidden layers with dropout & batch normalization.  
   
   6) Using 5 hidden layers without dropout & batch normalization. 
   
   7) Using 5 hidden layers with dropout & batch normalization
